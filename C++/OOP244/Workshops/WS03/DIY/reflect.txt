This workshop was pretty cool aswell I learned how to keep data private and how to making floating point values
im not sure if I did it the best way but I did have to make a temp class for both the trains to make sure they
were in a safe empty state to check since the transfer function is a global and not in the class so I had to 
get the private class values another way since that is the part of the privacy part I have learned also what
difference between methods and functions methods are in a class and functions are global outside of a class
I also learned safe states more in depth to make sure nothing is gonna break the program i'm learning more 
about modular programming and it is really cool concept and it was cool using a function to get the value
from a private standpoint it is really cool unthough it is harder but it is way better for us to know 1000%
excited to see what else more we learn in OOP!
