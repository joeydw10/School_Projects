I learned how to print text with a more OOP basis instead of using scanf, printf and \n we use cout, cin and endl I also learned what
namespaces are and how they work. All the code you write you wrap it with a namespace in our case it will be sdds i know also understand
more on how databases would look up something. they just turn the input to lowercase or upper it would do both the same then look for
it with the same exact case sensitivity. The most difficult part for me was I forgot adding an extra char to my array when adding
because it adds a '\0' to the end which takes a spot this made me get confused. Also I think I experienced a visual studio bug
because my name string was making the first char a '\0' and it had 51 max lenth (50) and i was even searching around the web to find
no answers because it was happening right after it read the line i didn't even do anything to change the string at all. I was very
annoyed at it but i tried another string var and it worked perfectly then I switched back to the name string and it work perfectly.
It was a very cool first workshop it made me understand the first cruical thing about C++ namespaces.
