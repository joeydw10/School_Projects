This workshop has been pretty cool to work on and the milestone 4 I need fardad's help for milestone for which all makes sense how what he
did and I never even thought of putting text in the state to make it a bad state which makes total sense because the state is good when
it is null or empty because that means you have no errors and that the object with the state is good to print save, load etc. No wonder
why I was stuck for so long but Fardad showing me that and saying my code looks good made me feel awesome I have been seeing my code become
better and better throughout the semester and im very proud of myself. Workshop 9 was not to bad I just had to read about how to read files
and save them and i'm just gonna say this c++ way of saving and loading in a file is 1000% times better than the C way in c++ we just do
it like cout or cin for loading or saving it is so much better and way easier to understand in a way which makes more sesne to me. However c++
is harder in other ways but we have the freedom to do all the other things which is great!
