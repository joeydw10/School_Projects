This workshop was medium level of difficulty my most struggles was with - 2 was not workiing so I
just did - 1 instead it all worked the same way in the end another issue I had was my values weren't
set right so I made them null at the start and that fixed that while also making sure to delete before
allocating a char Throughout this workshop I am learning more on how to be more OOP thinking and it
is making me really happy because I can see my self improving in programming all in all the workshop
was 6/10 in difficulty but other things are getting easier to understand doing it which is nice to
know that I am improving in programming skill ms2 for me was really easy which i would not be
able to say that before i came to school to do programming it is really cool that I can make
a whole menu to display in a loop I could not do that before I came here and i was really happy
doing that.
