this workshop was very weird to me it just felt so different then the normal code using templates felt like normal english to me like someone
could pick it up type of deal. It overall was not to bad difficulty wise and templates will very much help later in my programming life
since I can only imagine what we can do with it and it will be very cool to learn that later for the last workshop it was nice to end on a
easier workshop for this class. overall it took me a little bit to understand now to call a template and use it with another template
but it does make sense how it works and not to bad for it to be understandable it has been so long since I haven't programed only the 
project which I finished a couple of days I was so use to using cout and endl that I forgot to add iostream but because I was just using
cout all I needed was ostream and since we are in a header we don't use namespace so I had to also use std::cout and im just realzing now
that i forgot to add the comments for the template functions so now I'm going to resubmit it with the proper comments
