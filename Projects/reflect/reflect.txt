The whole project was good I felt it was hard enough but not to hard it was the perfect amount of not stressing really badly and cool to 
learn I really enjoyed the project I got next to none help expect for fardad for I think ms3? and other people just clarifying things I don't
remember who they are however it wasn't code they gave I would just ask for a clarifaction on the thing we have to code and then someone
would clarify it for me to understand better so then I can program it myself. I think the hardest milestone part for me was the remove one
i had on my loops - 1 because I thought that was gonna help and it did not long story short having - 1 on the deallocate loop ment me 
trying to fix a memory leak for several hours the all the other ones between 1-5 out of 10 for difficulty I would ask others what was
the harder milestones and I felt for the easy ones people said I would have a hard time but for the harder ones that people said I thought
were very easy including the update quantity one I thought that one was easy but the easiest milestone was for sure ms2 just for making the menu
I made that whole milestone finished in like 30 mins that to me is crazy before the 8 months that would take me several hours to do
but with schooling I did it that fast. That is proof that I have been getting better at programming on top of that I have learned how to be
more OOP minded for the dbs workshops and even WEB assignments it has made me become a lot better at programming and it will just go up from
